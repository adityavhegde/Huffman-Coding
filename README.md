# Huffman-Coding
This project is a part of the class of Advanced Data Structures: COP5536, University of Florida

The aim of this project is to compress a file using Huffman coding. 

**There are two parts to this project:**
1. Encoder
    - takes as input the large file 
    - generates the Huffman Code Table
    - generates a binary of the original input file
2. Decoder
    - decodes the binary to original input file using the code table and encoded binary
    
**Priority Queues:**
- Huffman Trees can be created with any of the three priority queues in the code viz Pairing Heap, 4-way cache optimized heap and Binary Heap
- The code contains implementations of the three heaps

**Todo:**
Remove bugs from pairing heap
